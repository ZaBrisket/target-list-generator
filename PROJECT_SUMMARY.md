## 💡 Key Implementation Details

### AI Accuracy-First Approach
- **Individual Processing:** Each company gets dedicated API call
- **Detailed Prompts:** 400-500 tokens with full context
- **Quality Validation:** Automated checks after each summary
- **Automatic Retry:** Up to 3 attempts with refinement
- **Cost:** ~$0.01 per company (~$2 for 200 companies)

### Excel Two-Tab Strategy
- **Tab 1 (Source Data):** Preserves original data for reference
- **Tab 2 (Target List):** Formatted output for presentation
- **Why:** User can manually edit summaries if needed, then regenerate PDF from Excel

### Title Block Format
```
Row 1: [Empty]
Row 2: [Report Title]                    [Company Name (optional)]
       ^- Merged cells C2:K2

Row 3: Acquisition Target Universe        ($ in millions)
       (Sorted by Est. Revenue)

Row 4: [Empty]

Row 5:                                   Est. Employee

Row 6: [Column Headers]

Row 7+: [Data Rows]
```

### Quality Validation Rules
1. Length: 100-180 chars (ideal 120-150)
2. Must include full company name
3. No generic phrases: "leading provider", "innovative solutions", etc.
4. Use industry terminology from Specialties field
5. Proper format: Capital start, period end
6. No truncation: no "...", "etc.", "and more"

## 📈 Cost Estimation

### Anthropic API
- **Per company:** ~$0.01
- **Per 200-company list:** ~$2.00
- **Monthly (light use):** ~$10-20
- **Monthly (heavy use):** ~$50-100

### Vercel Hosting
- **Hobby (free):** Has 10s timeout (won't work for large lists)
- **Pro ($20/mo):** Recommended for production (300s timeout)

### Total Monthly Cost (Production)
- **Vercel Pro:** $20
- **API usage (moderate):** $20-40
- **Total:** $40-60/month
